    abstract = {Fast charging is one of the most important features to be accomplished for the improvement of electric vehicles. In the search for optimal use of active materials for this aim, we present a recipe to find the conditions for fast charging, fifteen minutes for 80 % of the State-of-Charge, of lithium-ion battery's single particle electrodes, thus taking advantage of the maximum possible capacity. A guide based on a general model that considers diffusion and charge transfer limitations under constant current is proposed. This guide was constructed on the basis of our previous theoretical development. A Python free and user-friendly package is provided to handle all experimental data processing and estimations.}
