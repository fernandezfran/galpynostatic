# Changelog of galpynostatic

# v0.1.0 (2023-??-??)

This is the first Python object-oriented version of galpynostatic.

## Features

- A galvanostatic regressor to fit State-of-Charge (SOC) versus C-rates experimental data with the physics-based heuristic model implemented here. 
- Surface datasets of the continuous computational physics previous model for different single-particle geometries. 
- Visualization in different formats through a plotter.
- Make predictions on the optimal size characteristic of the fifteen-minute charging electrode material. 
- A preprocessing tool to obtain discharge capacities from galvanostatic profile, useful to define the SOC values.

## Software quality assurance

- Runs on Ubuntu with Python 3.8+.
- Documentation available in readthedocs with installation guide, tutorial and API reference.
- Multiple unit tests.
- 100% coverage.
- PEP8 style code assured with flake8 and extensions.
